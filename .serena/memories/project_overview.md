qBit Mobile is a Vite-based React + TypeScript single page app with an Express proxy/server that wraps the qBittorrent WebUI API. TailwindCSS powers styling and TanStack Query handles async data/state. The repo includes the frontend under `src/` (components, pages, hooks, contexts, services, utils, types) and a small Node/Express backend in `server/server.js` that serves static assets and proxies API calls to qBittorrent. Deployment scripts (`deploy.sh`, `uninstall.sh`) set up a systemd service, with env configuration stored in `.env`. Builds output to `dist/`.
